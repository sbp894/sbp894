- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sbp894
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ~all things signal processing and machine learning, especially related to neuroscience and speech 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently comparing the performance and confusion-matrix pattern of our feature-based model (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.25.509412v1.abstract) with that of modern deep networks in classifying phonemes.
